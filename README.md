# Card-Set-Manipulation-Using-C-
A program written to flair the object oriented programming capacities of the C++ language in the context of playing cards. The program allows the user to leverage on the functionalities provided by the CardSet class that enables creating a card set, shuffling it, dealing from a card set (viz. returning the topmost card in the set), dealing into multiple sets (viz., alternately distributing cards of the present set into two or more sets), adding a specific new card to the card set, merge shuffling with another card set and displaying the contents of the set.
